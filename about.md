<h1 class="custom-title">About Me</h1>
<div class="custom-subtitle">Just a simple introduction</div>

I'm Brandon, an analyst at Monash University and a part-time research assistant at Deakin University. At Monash, I work in the Faculty of Arts, focusing on data analytics and modelling. My research at Deakin specialises in machine learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP).

Besides work and research, my absolute favourite thing to do is spend time with my partner and our beautiful English Staffy Muffin. Typically, if I am not working or learning, I am with Muffin and my partner, either going for walks or just chilling at home binging the next best series.

Most of what I post here will revolve around my interests and learning, especially in solving problems related to data, algorithms, and other intriguing topics. I believe this is a great way to hold myself accountable for my learning and to practice communicating the ideas I've learned, which is an invaluable skill to have (also to solidify my own understanding). 

Thank you for reading!
